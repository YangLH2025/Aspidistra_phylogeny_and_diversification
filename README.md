The resulting trees and customized scripts used in our research are provided here. In this study, we infered well-resolved phylogenies for the genus of Aspidistra using both concatenation- and coalescent-based methods. Then, we explored the diversification patterns of the genus and underlying processes based on morphological and geological data by applying a series of time-, environment-, diversity-, and trait-dependent models, and we further used the phylogenetic confirmatory path analysis (PPA) to assess the synergistic effects of abiotic and biotic factors on diversification.
