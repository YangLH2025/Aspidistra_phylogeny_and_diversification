The resulting trees and customized scripts used in our research are provided here. In this study, we inffered well-resolved phylogenies for the genus of Aspdistra using both concatenation- and coalescent-based methods, and we further explored the diversification patterns of the genus and underlying processes based on morphological and geological data by applying a series of time-, environment-, diversity-, and trait-dependent models, as well as the phylogenetic confirmatory path analysis, to assess the synergistic effects of abiotic and biotic factors on diversification.
